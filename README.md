This is a demo app you can tap through to see how payments work on Firefox OS.
At the time of this writing the demo is already out of date with the real
Firefox OS payment system :)

Open this URL in a Firefox OS browser to install the app:
http://kumar303.github.io/payments-demo/

Deploy to github pages:

    npm install
    volo build && volo ghdeploy
